      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      

  <p>Linux is an open-source operating system based on the Unix operating system. It was first released in 1991 by Linus Torvalds, and has since become one of the most widely-used operating systems in the world. Linux is built on a monolithic kernel and is available in a wide variety of distributions (such as Ubuntu, Red Hat, Debian, etc.)

The purpose of Linux is to provide a stable, efficient, and secure operating system that can be used for a wide range of tasks, from personal use to enterprise-level server and system administration. Linux is particularly popular in the server and enterprise space due to its stability, scalability, and security features.

Companies use Linux in system administration in various ways:

Server operating system: Linux is widely used as a server operating system, running web servers, mail servers, database servers, and other types of servers. It is considered more stable and secure than other operating systems, such as Windows Server.

Cloud computing: Linux is the primary operating system used in cloud computing environments, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform.

Networking: Linux is widely used in network devices like routers, switches, and firewalls.

Virtualization: Many companies use Linux as the host operating system for virtualization platforms, such as KVM and Xen.

Storage: Linux is widely used in storage solutions, such as Network Attached Storage (NAS) and Storage Area Networks (SAN).

Embedded systems: Linux is used in embedded systems such as mobile phones, routers, and other IoT devices.

In summary, Linux is a versatile and powerful operating system that is widely used in various areas of system administration, such as servers, networking, virtualization, and storage, due to its stability, scalability and security.</p>

      <h2>Milestones</h2>
      <h3>Milestone 1</h3>
      <p>Docker is a popular platform that enables the creation and management of containerized applications. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient units that package an application and its dependencies together, making it easy to deploy and run the application on different environments.</p>
      <h3>Milestone 2</h3>
      <p>Provide a brief description of the second milestone and its progress.</p>
